# code-quiz

My Code quiz is basic setup with its main index html presenting the user with a "take quiz" button. The quiz has 4 mulitple choice questions which are presented and then tallied up with the correct and incorrect answers to present a percentage at the end. You can scoll down to see all the previous scores you had before.

I used Bulma to style my page.
